# PayWise - Digital Wallet

payWise is a digital wallet application developed for my computer science degree's final project. The application's main purpose is to centralize refunds, vouchers, and discounts for users. With payWise, users can conveniently manage and keep track of their available benefits.

## Features

- **Centralized Benefit Management:** The application provides a single platform where users can store and manage all their refunds, vouchers, and discounts.

- **Expiry Notifications:** Users receive notifications about upcoming voucher expirations, ensuring they don't miss out on utilizing their discounts.

- **Location-Based Services:** The integration of Google Maps enables users to find and navigate to the nearest stores where they can use their vouchers and discounts.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end:** The user-friendly interface is built using React.

- **Back-end:** Django handles the back-end development, including database management, user authentication, and business logic.

- **Database:** MySQL is used to store and manage user data, vouchers, and refund information.

The project's goal is to create a seamless and efficient digital wallet experience for users, providing them with a tool to maximize the value of their refunds and discounts.
